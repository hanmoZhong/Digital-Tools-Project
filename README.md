## Project Structure
1.Data Source

We collect G10 currency from FRED, an open economic datasource. We take G10 currency to U.S dollar daily sopt exchange rate data from 2021/11/08 to 2022/10/28 which is one year before our research project begins.

The G10 currencies are: Australian dollar(al), Pound sterling(uk), Euro(eu), Swiss franc(sz), Norwegian krone(no), Japanese yen(jp),Canadian dollar(ca), New Zealand dollar(nz), Swedish krona(sd) and USD which we use as a base currency since our investor is an American resident.
